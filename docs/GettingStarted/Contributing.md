## Submitting your code

Before submitting â€“ always make sure to build and run unit tests (we won't merge any request that fails Travis CI)

Pushing directly to the master branch is prohibited so if you make changes put it on a new branch and make a pull request to have your changes merged into master after being reviewed.
